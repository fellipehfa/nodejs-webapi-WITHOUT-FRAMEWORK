# Building a complete Node.js WebApi + testing with no frameworks

Welcome, this repo is about Creating and Testing a complete Node.js Rest API (With no frameworks). 

This repo is a challenge from Erick [Wendel's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh84012dEUE076wM2CVFN9A), so if you're interested in finding out more, take a look at his channel.

## Source code of the examples showed in his class

## Features Checklist + Challenges

- Web API
    - [ ] it should have an endpoint for storing heroes' data
    - [ ] it should have an endpoint for retrieving heroes' data

- Testing
    - Unit
        - [ ] it should test all files on the routes layer

        - [ ] it should test all files on the factories layer
        - Plus
          - [ ] it should reach 100% code coverage (it's currently not possible to get code coverage metrics using only the native Node.js, see [c8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/c8) for this task)

    - Integration / E2E
        - [ ] it should test the endpoint for storing heroes' data
